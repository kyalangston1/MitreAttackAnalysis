Before delving into reconnaissance, its first important to understand what this means to cybersecurity. 

What is Reconnaissance?
I'd like to preface while the term is relevant to ethical hacking or penetration techniques
for gathering or uncovering information about a system, it is not specifically utilized only within this 
context, and not limited to determine network range, identifying active machines, finding access points and open
ports etc.. Rather it's main goal is to collectively gather information before launching a specific, or wide range attack.
